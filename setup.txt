Thank you for downloading and using my program, SmartNotesCE!
The following instructions will tell you how to send the program to your calculator, run the program, and start taking notes!
The first thing you need to do is to download TI Connect CE and install it. 
If you have questions, refer to this video for help: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TweNnHuFCQ
Then, plug in your calculator (it has to be a ti-84 plus ce or ti 83 color edition) via the charging cable that came with it, to your computer usb hub
Then, drag'n drop all the blue and green files inside the smart_notes_ce folder onto the ti connect ce window (yes, you do have to open the app).
Then, hit the prgm button on your calculator, scroll down to the program called "notes", and click enter to run it.
