### A text editor for the TI 84 Plus CE calculator written in C.
## Download and / or run at your own risk! This project is known to have numerous bugs currently.
If you use or modify my code in any way in a public project, then please credit me for all of my code that you used, modified, or used in any way! By the way, if you are a beginning developer in C, I would encourage you to use/modify my [inputString](https://github.com/randomguy70/SmartNotesCE/blob/521253caf59c80d1f80eb029ee82a46bda4e9c1d/smart_notes_ce/src/includesCode/text.c#L3) function for any TI 84 plus CE calculator programs that you make; it is pretty fast, efficient, has a blinking cursor, and supports lowercase, uppercase, and number modes, and takes up far less room than the standard scanf() function that comes with the TI 84 Plus CE toolchain.
Thank you!
