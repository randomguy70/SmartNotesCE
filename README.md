# **SmartNotesCE, created by Randomguy.**

### A text editor for the TI 84 Plus CE calculator written in C.

## Download and / or run at your own risk! This project is known to have numerous bugs currently. 

If you use or modify my code in any way in a public project, then please credit me for all of my code that you were inspired by, modified, or used in any way! By the way, if you are a beginning developer in [C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)) for the CE, I would encourage you to use/modify my [inputString](https://github.com/randomguy70/SmartNotesCE/blob/521253caf59c80d1f80eb029ee82a46bda4e9c1d/smart_notes_ce/src/includesCode/text.c#L3) function for any [TI 84 plus CE](https://education.ti.com/en/products/calculators/graphing-calculators/ti-84-plusce) calculator programs that you write in C; it is pretty fast, efficient, has a blinking cursor, and supports lowercase, uppercase, and number modes, and takes up far less room than the standard [scanf()](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/c_standard_library/c_function_scanf.htm) function that comes with the [TI 84 Plus CE toolchain.](https://github.com/CE-Programming/toolchain/releases/tag/v9.1) In addition, you can check out the CE documentation [here](https://ce-programming.github.io/toolchain/index.html), and if you have any questions feel free to ask them on [Cemetech.](https://cemetech.net)
Thank you!

## This project could not have been done (probably) without the constant help and guidance of (including but not limited to) these coders on [Cemetech](https://www.cemetech.net), a TI Calculator software development site (mostly for the TI 84 Plus CE, because it is the best)
- Jacobly
  - helped create the CE C toolchain
  - created [this function](https://github.com/randomguy70/SmartNotesCE/blob/8dbbe24928ba71f39dc3627c0b699b59bafe70bd/smart_notes_ce/src/includesCode/key.c#L6) that returns the OS_GetCSC value of the last key pressed using the ultra-fast kb_ data array.
